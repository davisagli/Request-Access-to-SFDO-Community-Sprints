# Request Access to join an [SFDO-Community-Sprint](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints) Project!

## Purpose of this Repository

In order to join an SFDO-Community-Sprint Project, Contributor access must first be requested.

### What does it mean to be a Contributor?

A successful open source project takes more than a dedicated project team of maintainers. Believe it or not - it takes volunteers - like you - who are interested in furthering its success. As a Contributor, you will work with project teams to brainstorm and develop solutions for a variety of use cases, solve for gaps in existing functionality, create or improve upon documentation, and have organic conversations that help drive the project forward. Most contributions happen during the four in-person Open Source Community Sprints we host each year in the United States and Europe - and now virtually. Take a moment and review the [Projects](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints) that are currently being worked on. They could use your help!

And no - you don't have to be a developer to be a Project Contributor. But if you are - you're more than welcome to join too!
